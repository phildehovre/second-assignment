          Phwirlde is word guessing game and it is my implementation of a very
          popular game owned by a historically popular American newspaper.
          <br />
          <br />
          This implementation is written entirely in
          <span class="text-bg-dark" style="display: inline-block"
            >vanilla Javascript</span
          >. I challenged myself to code this application in two afternoons
          without the help of any tutorials. Sure, I could have used React and
          some fancy libraries. But where is the fun in that? The purpose of
          this exercise was to build a production-level browser game under very
          specific time and tooling constraints.

          As a musician turned developer, I've embraced the world of
          programming, creating applications, and websites. My coding journey
          began during the lockdowns in 2020, and I've since tackled diverse
          projects, demonstrating a can-do attitude and a passion for clean
          code. My multilingual skills, including native proficiency in French
          and English, are assets that enable effective communication in diverse
          teams. I'm excited about opportunities to contribute my skills and
          enthusiasm to innovative organizations, I look forward to discussing
          how I can make a meaningful impact on your team.
